# Sales Data Analysis using SQLite & Python  

This project demonstrates how to use Python with SQLite to analyze sales data.  
A small database (`sales_data.db`) is created, queried using SQL, loaded into Pandas,  
and visualized using Matplotlib.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python (sqlite3, pandas, matplotlib)
- SQLite database
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📌 Project Workflow
1. Created/loaded SQLite database (`sales_data.db`)
2. Inserted sample sales data (product, quantity, price)
3. Connected Python to SQLite
4. Wrote SQL queries to calculate:
   - Total quantity sold per product  
   - Total revenue per product  
5. Loaded SQL results into Pandas DataFrame
6. Visualized:
   - Bar chart: Total Quantity Sold  
   - Bar chart: Total Revenue by Product  
7. Additional insights:
   - Highest revenue product  
   - Highest quantity sold product  
   - Total revenue

## 📊 Output
- Clear DataFrame summary  
- Two charts showing quantity and revenue  
- SQL insights extracted and displayed  

## 📁 Files Included
- Jupyter Notebook (`sales_sqlite_analysis.ipynb`)
- SQLite DB file (`sales_data.db`)
- README.md
